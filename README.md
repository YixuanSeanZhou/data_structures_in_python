# Implements Several Advanced Data Structues Via Python

While taking the advanced data structures class (CSE 100) at UCSD, I feel like I should try impelemnt all those in python (maybe for future uses)

### Data Structures Learned

#### Trees:
- Regular BST
- Heap
  - Ordered by importance
- K-D Tree
- Treap
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- MutiwayTries
  - Inefficient in space if we pre-determine all the possible ways i.e. the alphabet.
    - Better performance in a dense lexicon.
  - Without pre-determine the alphabet, the algorithm is O(log(n) * k) where k is the size of the alphabet, n is the number of nodes being inserted.
- Ternary Tree
  - Both space and time complexit in between BST and Tries

#### Hash Table



#### Implemented Data Structues
- Tries (Multiway Trie)
