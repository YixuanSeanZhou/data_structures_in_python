# Implements Several Advanced Data Structues Via Python

While taking the advanced data structures class (CSE 100) at UCSD, I feel like I should try impelemnt all those in python (maybe for future uses)

### Data Structures Learned

#### Trees:
- Regular BST
- Heap
  - Ordered by importance
- K-D Tree
- Treap
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Ternary Tree

#### Implemented Data Structues
- Tries (Multiway Trie)
